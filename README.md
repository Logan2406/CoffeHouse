# NewCoffeeHouse (Restaurant Management Website)

This website is created with the purpose of learning advanced topics in React and Express Js.
The basic functionality of the project is to have a full fledged Restaurant Management system, where
not only users but for the admins and restaurant managers can use the system for their day to day bussiness.

There are three views of the website:

    1. Users without Logining in
    2. Admin section
    3. Users with Login 

### Users without Logining-in View
Here any user can view the vacancy of the table and then will decide whether to movein to the restaurant or not.

They can see the Menu according to their category and also can filter out the results over their choices.

This website is not for the food ordering so, people cannot order the food without booking a table. The booking
of the table can be done by the restaurant admin team only.


### Admin section View

Admin section is only authorised for the restaurant owner, and management team. I have built an authentication 
system for both category admin and users

Whenever anyone is entering in the restaurant, the admin department will book a table with and a seat allotment 
will be done utill they are paying the bill and exiting from the restaurant.

The booking is done with the phone no. If he/she is new to the restaurant and the phone no is not in the record 
then, an new OTP will be send to the user's mobile no. that will be his/her password. He/she can change the password later on.


After the seat booking , users can ask the restaurant management to place the order according to their choices.
Hence the order can be placed from the website only by the management staffs.

Admin can see currently which seats are still booked and which table has what orders.

When users are done with their food then they can pay the bill using any method to the billing counter, they will 
get the bill on their respective mobile number. After paying the bill, the admin team can remove the user from 
the booked to bill payed and hence the allotment will be over with that.

Admin can see the all the orders of the previous days, week and current one according to their choices and
hence can analyse the statics of the restaurant.
